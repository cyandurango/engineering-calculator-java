# **engineering-calculator-java** | Java-based Calculator Application for General Engineering Needs

This is an all-in-one calculator application that tackles the major topics of Statistics, Circuitry, Calculus, and Economics. It consists of the following general calculators:
1. [Statistics Calculator](#general-statistics-calculator)
2. [Resistor Color Code Calculator](#resistor-color-code-calculator)
3. [Polynomial Derivatives Calculator](#polynomial-derivatives-calculator)
4. [Basic Economics Calculator](#engineering-economics-calculator).

## **General Statistics Calculator**
Given a set of numbers, the statistics calculator renders statistical information such as the highest number, lowest number, range, mean, median, mode, standard deviation and variance (depending whether the samples are treated as a population or a sample) 

## **Resistor Color Code Calculator**
The Resistor Color Code Calculator calculates the estimated resistance of a resistor based on the present color bands and its tolerance bounds. Additionally, it also takes the resistance value and tolerance percentage to calculates its equivalent color code. The application performs these calculations for 3-band, 4-band, and 5-band resistors.

## **Polynomial Derivatives Calculator**
The Polynomial Derivatives Calculator functions as it is described. It calculates the derivatives of polynomial functions only, namely in the form of: $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ . . . +a_1x^1+a$. 

## **Engineering Economics Calculator**
This calculator takes into account general economics problems limited to simple interest, compound interest, and annuity economics problems.
